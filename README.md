### Hi! Here are things about me:

🖐 I'm Mati, currently a 19-years-old student in computer science at EPITA in Paris, France.

💾 I started my journey in computing by learning how to code in C back in 2010,
before quickly diving into web programming languages for the quick development pace they allowed me.
Nowadays I know and use regularly several programming languages.

🧰 I work on multiple and various projects, although none are both public and stable enough to be showcased yet.

👤 You can read more about me by looking at my [Curriculum Vitae](https://matiboux.me/cv) and my [work timeline](https://matiboux.me/timeline),
where you'll find info about some of my projects.
